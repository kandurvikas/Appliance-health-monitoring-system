# Appliance-health-monitoring-system
Our idea uses the Raspberry Pi, a single-board computer with minimal cost, to provide an immediate health monitoring system for electrical equipment. The technology has the ability to measure energy usage and spot any problems with appliance performance. The user enters the energy tariff and the number of hours the gadget will be used in order to operate the system. Along with various electrical metrics, the device displays the cost and units utilised immediately. Our technology includes a colour-coding system to enable consumers readily assess the condition of their electrical equipment in addition to delivering real-time data on energy use. The following is the colour-coding system: Green: indicates that the gadget is using its rated power. Yellow: A reactive power error of 0–10% is present when the appliance is running. Orange: There is a 10–20% reactive power error when the appliance is running. Red: There is a 20–30% reactive power error when the appliance is running. Users may quickly spot possible faults with their appliances using this colour-coded approach and take preventative action to remedy them. This function is essential for increasing the effectiveness of appliances and reducing electrical waste, which can lower energy expenditures. Additionally, using our programmed energy metre removes the risk of human mistake that is frequently connected to manual data entering. As a result, more precise data are collected, which is necessary for performing efficient electrical system health monitoring. Another benefit of our solution is that it enables efficient health monitoring, which may assist in locating appliance fault areas and reducing energy use. Users may lower their energy use and save money by finding locations where their appliances are malfunctioning. Finally, the inclusion of a real-time health monitoring system powered by a Raspberry Pi to our project gives consumers a useful tool for keeping tabs on the functioning of their electrical equipment. This results in health monitoring that is more accurate, which can aid in locating appliance malfunctions, eliminating energy waste, and lowering energy expenses. Users are given insightful information about the performance of their appliances by the colour-coded system and historical data analysis, enabling them to make wise decisions.
